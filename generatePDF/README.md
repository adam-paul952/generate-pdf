## Getting Started

**Must have Node installed to run this program**

<br>

**[Download Node.js Here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)**

Once Node is installed by default the NPM package manager will be installed. Start by running

```
npm install
```

or

```
npm i
```

in the root directory of the program. This will install all packages included in the package.json.
